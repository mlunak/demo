# Fun App

  - back end SpringBoot application written in Kotlin
  - database files for Postgres database (Dockerfile image and Flyway migration scripts)
- builds with Gradle
- does nothing useful (so far)
- is open for your ideas

### Things you may need to work with and run this application:

- [Gradle Wrapper](/gradlew) which should be here (no need to install Gradle separately)
- OpenJDK17 [RedHat](https://developers.redhat.com/products/openjdk/download) for instance
- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download)
- Some IDE preferably IDEA

### How to write this file:

- [GitHub syntax](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)

### Some ideas to do:

- dockerize - create docker-compose file, network etc.
- improve angular front end app, create new screens, improve existing
